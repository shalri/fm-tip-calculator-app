### What I learned

I used NextJS for this challenge. Since I plan to integrate Frontend Mentor
into my study routine, I might as well play around with NextJS and React alongside the
challenges.

Implementing this challenge with NextJS made it more interesting. It gave me
a broader scope for learning.

I had so much fun with this challenge. It was challenging but well worth it. I am
pleased with how I implemented the logic for the app. This really helped me
develop a deeper understanding of hooks.

This challenge also showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of the time
pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout just right. I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I like learning and practicing new concepts.
